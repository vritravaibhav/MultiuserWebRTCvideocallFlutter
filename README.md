# webrtcvideocall

A new Flutter project.
# This is Multiuser video call project using WEBRTC, firebase and flutter.

Steps to run this project:

 STEP 1: clone this project( main branch will also work but optimizing branch code has better ui and Functional)
 
 STEP 2: Open teminal then run this command "Flutter pub get"/n
 
 STEP 3: Add your own firebase database because (reason explained below). Change database firebase rule bcause there's no authentication.

 STEP 4: Run the project (if error comes fix using stackoverflow or any other way)
 
 Step 5: After opening app u will see a Textfield and join room button. In textfield enter some unique value (unguessable input) every time.  reason explained below,
and Enter same unique value in other smartphones to enter in same room.

Why unique value??

  when u enter unique value in texfield and join room. I create a collection named unique value in firebase so when u entered that value again it will still work but some black screen will also come of old user who entered in this room previously or add your own databse or add some unique value.
